        <strong>Description: </strong>Journey through the land of imagination to explore theater in a truly sensational way! This course looks at drama holistically as we help students use their mind, body, emotions and spirit to explore the dramatic arts! Beginning with our imaginations, we implement fun and creative workshops to develop and build on the fundamentals of theater, such as: scene setting, expression, proper breathing, and character analysis. Students will become familiar with the many functions of a working theater and what it takes to make a successful theatrical production as they prepare for and present a play during the spring semester. Of note, a small number (10-12) of limited spots are available.</p>

      <strong>Description:</strong>  This class is foundational for a lifetime of loving music. We will explore the concepts of rhythm, pitch, note-reading, and music appreciation in a fun and friendly environment. Students will enjoy playing instruments, singing songs from all over the world and learning to work together as a choir. Large motor skills, ear-training, correct vocal placement, mathematical concepts, reading skills and mental retention are all exercised and improved upon as the year progresses. Students and their families are offered field trip opportunities throughout the year and will participate in performances throughout the community. What a fun way to learn! &quot;Early musical training helps develop brain areas involved in language and reasoning. It is thought that brain development continues for many years after birth. Recent studies have clearly indicated that musical training physically develops the part of the left side of the brain known to be involved with processing language.&rdquo; (Carolyn  Phillips, <u>Twelve Benefits of Music Education</u>.) </p>
